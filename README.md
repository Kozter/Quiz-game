# Multiple Choice Quiz - With user login

## Project description:

### The aim of this project is to make a multiple-choice quiz using Python, which contains 10 questions about Norway.  

-When  the  user  runs  the  code,  first  he/she  should  be  asked  to  enter  a username and password as login information.

-The  login  information  is kept within a dictionary, and the dictionary are passed to a function called login_info along with
the username and password entered by the user,to check whether or not the login is successful. 

-If yes, the user should see the first question and should be able to enter his/her answer 
to that question. Then, the second question should be visible to the user to answer, and so on.

-If the login is not successful, the message “Invalid username and/or password” must be printed and the user should be 
able to enter a new username and a password until they are valid, and the login is successful. 

-At the end, the program should report the number of correct and wrong answers for the quiz and print the correct answers for 
those  questions  answered  wrong  by  the  user.
